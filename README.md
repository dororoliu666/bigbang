# AI Tools Index

This repository contains a static website for browsing AI tools. Tools can be filtered by category, searched by name or description, and rated on a 0â€“100 scale using a slider. Ratings are stored locally in your browser using `localStorage`.

Open `index.html` in your browser to use the site. The layout is responsive and uses a grid of cards for each tool.
